 * A utility class for generating cryptographically secure random strings and nonces.
 * - Description: The `EntropyGenerator` class provides methods for generating cryptographically secure random strings and nonces. It leverages the system's secure random number generator to ensure the randomness and security of the generated values.
 * - Remark: This class uses the system's secure random number generator to generate random bytes and indices.
 * - Remark: The `randomString` and `randomNonceString` functions can be used to generate random strings and nonces, respectively.
