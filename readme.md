# Dice ðŸŽ²

> Random string generator

### Description
Utilizes a Nonce-based approach, leveraging entropy derived from kinetic inputs and other sources to enhance security.

### Example
```swift
let recipe: RandomPassword.PasswordRecipe = (4,0, Int.random(in: 2...8)) // Define a password recipe with 4 words and a separator, and a random word length between 2 and 8
let psw = try? RandomPassword.randomPassword(recipe: recipe) // Generate a random password using the given recipe, and assign it to `psw`
Swift.print("psw:  \(String(describing: psw))")
```
### Resources
- Apple has a built in validator and generator: Research `UITextInputPasswordRules` https://nshipster.com/uitextinputpasswordrules/

### Gotcha:
- Diceware is a method used to generate cryptographically strong passphrases. It is based on the principle that truly random selection of words from a wordlist can result in easily memorable passwords that are also extremely resistant to attack.

### Todo
- Make more tests
- Consider using apples password generator `UITextInputPasswordRules` for generating passwords
- Consider creating a warning system for weak passwords audit (healthCheck) based on apples `UITextInputPasswordRules`
- Improve Dice API 1 https://github.com/mssun/passforios/blob/master/passKit/Passwords/PasswordGenerator.swift
- Improve Dice API 2 https://github.com/keepassium/KeePassium/blob/master/KeePassiumLib/KeePassiumLib/util/PasswordGenerator.swift
- Improve Dice API 3 https://gist.github.com/brennanMKE/7b740c57cabfe16f337464f504fcb100
- Improve Dice API 4 (This has a nice reduce ) https://mgrebenets.github.io/swift/2015/02/23/password-generator-in-swift
- Make entropy test to verify good distribution
- Password generator with crypto secure SecRandomCopyBytes: https://github.com/RolfKr/Days/blob/6a556a83a87cd27526ef2b56fb93bf0bcd3ac302/Days/Supporting%20Files/Helper.swift
- https://checkmarx.com/de/blog/security-mistakes-developing-swift-applications-test/
- Remove the resoure files. or move to mockgen lib?

### Psudo code for entropy test:
```swift
For the SecRandom password generator code.
Just hit the method enough times and check occurrence rate of similar characters etc.
Passwords = 1000*1000
Occurences = [:]
CharSet.forEach{
   Occurences[$0] +=Passwords.occurenceOf($0)
}
```

### Symetric key:
Generates a random symmetric key that can be used for encryption

```swift
import Foundation
import Security

func computeSymmetricKey() -> String? {
    // Create a new `Data` object with 32 bytes (256 bits) of count
    var keyData = Data(count: 32)
    // Generate random bytes using `SecRandomCopyBytes` and store them in `keyData`
    let result = keyData.withUnsafeMutableBytes {
        (mutableBytes: UnsafeMutablePointer) -> Int32 in
        SecRandomCopyBytes(kSecRandomDefault, keyData.count, mutableBytes)
    }
    // If the result is successful, return the base64-encoded string of `keyData`
    if result == errSecSuccess {
        return keyData.base64EncodedString()
    // If the result is not successful, return `nil`
    } else {
        return nil
    }
}
let secretKey = computeSymmetricKey()
```
